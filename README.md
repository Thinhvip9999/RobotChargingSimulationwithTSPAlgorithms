# RobotChargingSimulationwithTSPAlgorithms

This project is entirely coded in GAMA to demonstrate that GAMA can be used to implement algorithms beyond its built-in capabilities.

## Overview

The Robot Charging Simulation with TSP (Traveling Salesperson Problem) Algorithms project aims to simulate the process of robot charging using various TSP algorithms. The primary goal is to optimize the path taken by robots to reach their charging stations, minimizing the overall distance traveled.

## Features

- Implementation of different TSP algorithms in GAMA.
- Simulation of robot movements and charging processes.
- Visualization of the optimized paths for robot charging.
- Customizable parameters for simulation experiments.
- Detailed logging and analysis of simulation results.

## Technologies Used

- **GAMA**: The simulation platform used to code and run the algorithms.
- **GAML**: The programming language used within GAMA for model development.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Thinhvip9999/RobotChargingSimulationwithTSPAlgorithms.git
